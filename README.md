# Exploring-Interaction-Data

## Description
This project contains the code used to analyse interaction data log's, captured from the music composition tool Codetta.

It uses a dataset of compositions (.xml) and interation logs (.csv) created by me, as a "pilot analysis" for a larger study - collecting a dataset from children using Codetta to write their own compositions. 

Essessially, each compostion will be judged in term's of creativeness (google Amabile Consenstual Assesment), and then a linear regreesion (or different model) will be used to see what iteractions with Codetta best support creativity.
