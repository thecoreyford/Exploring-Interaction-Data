# Exploring-Interaction-Data

## Description
This project contains the code used to analyse interaction data log's, captured from the music composition tool Codetta.

It uses a dataset of compositions (.xml) and interation logs (.csv) created by me, as a "pilot analysis" for a larger study - collecting a dataset from children using Codetta to write their own compositions. 

If accessing this from NIME, the reason that only this example project is provided is that the children's data needed to be destroyed as a condition of the ethics review. This is indicitive of the analysis that is described in the paper.
